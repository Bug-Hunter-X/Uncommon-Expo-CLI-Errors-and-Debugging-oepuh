# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors and Debugging

This repository demonstrates troubleshooting strategies for unusual errors encountered when using the Expo CLI.  These errors often stem from environment-specific issues rather than obvious coding mistakes.  The examples provided focus on identifying and resolving these types of problems.

## Common Scenarios

* **Unexpected dependency conflicts:**  The project may have incompatible versions of packages, or missing peer dependencies.
* **Incorrect environment setup:** Problems with Node.js version, operating system configurations, or Expo CLI installation.
* **Incorrect project setup:**  A mismatch between the project's `package.json` and the Expo CLI expectations.
* **Caching issues:**  Corrupted cache in Expo CLI may lead to unexpected behavior. 
* **Permissions issues:**  Insufficient permissions on the local system to write or access required files.

## Steps for Debugging

1. **Check the Complete Error Message:** Read the *entire* error message from the Expo CLI carefully. Often a root cause is hinted at in additional lines that follow the initial error summary. 
2. **Clean the Project:** Delete the `node_modules` folder and `yarn.lock` (or `package-lock.json`). Reinstall packages with `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. **Check Node.js Version:** Ensure you have a supported Node.js version as specified in the Expo documentation.
4. **Check Expo CLI Version:** Make sure you have the latest version of the Expo CLI installed: `expo upgrade`
5. **Verify Project Structure:** Double-check that your project structure adheres to the Expo conventions.
6. **Clear Cache:**  Try clearing the Expo CLI cache:  `expo prebuild --clean`
7. **Examine Package.json:**  Review dependencies for conflicting versions and ensure all peer dependencies are met.
8. **Permissions:** Ensure the current user has necessary write permissions in the project directory.
9. **Check System Logs:** Sometimes, additional details might be found in system logs, particularly under Windows.
