// This file demonstrates solutions to various uncommon Expo CLI errors.
// It doesn't contain specific code because the bugs themselves are not code-based but environmental.
// The focus here is on the process of troubleshooting and identifying the root causes of uncommon Expo CLI issues.

// Example: Handling dependency conflict
// Solution: Check 'package.json' and 'package-lock.json'. Manually inspect and address any conflicting versions.
// Use 'npm ls' or 'yarn why' to understand the dependency tree and potential conflicts

// Example: Handling a corrupted cache
// Solution: run 'expo prebuild --clean' to clear the cache. Then, reinstall all the dependencies, i.e., 'npm install'

// Example: Handling permission errors
// Solution: Run command prompt or terminal as administrator and try running commands again.

// Example: Dealing with unexpected errors after upgrading Expo CLI
// Solution: Run 'expo prebuild --clean' and then try rebuilding the project. If problems persist, check the release notes for potential breaking changes in the new Expo version.

// Example: Node version issues
// Solution: Refer to Expo's documentation to determine the recommended Node.js version for your project and update accordingly.
